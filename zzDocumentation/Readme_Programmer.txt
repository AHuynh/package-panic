This Readme is for Programmers. Updated 1-17-15.

[Dependencies]
- FlashDevelop
- Git/GitHub

[Brief Overview]
Package Panic is written in ActionScript 3. We will use the free FlashDevelop to work with this.
You can pick it up here: http://www.flashdevelop.org/

You will also want to have Git to at least pull the latest version of the game from GitHub.
The project repository is here: https://github.com/AHuynh/package-panic
*Email me (a.huynh@gatech.edu) your GitHub username so I can add you to the repo as a contributor.*

[Setup]
A more detailed tutorial on setup will be provided in Package Panic meetings.
If you wish to get a headstart, grab FlashDevelop and Git.

You can start looking at the source code at the project repo on GitHub.
You'll want to pay special attention to the folders/files:
package-panic/src/packpan/levels
package-panic/src/packpan/mails
package-panic/src/packpan/nodes
package-panic/src/cobaltric/ABST_ContainerGame.as

(I don't expect anyone to be able to get the project working in FlashDevelop on their own without help. FD can be extremely terrible to set up. So don't feel bad if you can't get it to work! If you do, though, you're like, a super-wizard.)

[Tasks]
- Come up with ideas for new levels
- Come up with ideas for new mail (items to be manipulated by machines)
- Come up with ideas for new nodes (machines on the factory floor)
- Find an idea with art finished for it, but needing code (not yet, though)
